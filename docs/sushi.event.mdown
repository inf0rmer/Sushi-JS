# Event

A small publish/subscribe event library. You can mix it in with your objects to give them superhero event powers.

It's really just three functions, but you get a metric ton of aliases because everybody loves binding events differently.

* **subscribe**, **bind**, **on**: Execute a callback when a named event is triggered
* **unsubscribe**, **unbind**, **off**: Stop listening to this event
* **publish**, **trigger**, **fire**: Trigger an event, pass parameters with it
