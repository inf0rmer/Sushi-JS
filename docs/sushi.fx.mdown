Special effects are the whole point of the Web, so there you go: a minimal animation library.
It uses CSS transitions exclusively, JS animations suck.
You can turn all animations off by setting ```$.fx.off = true```

* **animate**, **anim**: Animate CSS properties in a time lapse.
* **fadeIn**
* **fadeOut**
* **fadeToggle**
