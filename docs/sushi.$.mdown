# Sushi(), or $()

This module replaces the noop Sushi/$ function with a sort-of jQuery DOM API. It requires various other modules and builds a coherent bridge for common interoperability.

In a nutshell, here's what you get:

* AJAX, from sushi.ajax
* A querySelectorAll API, from sushi.qwery
* A DOM utility, from sushi.bonzo
* A DOM event utility, from sushi.bean
